# SquadUp

The SquadUp MVP. SquadUp is a social network centered around the idea of groups coming together for events.


# Core Feature List
- [ ] Allow users to create squads. (Groups)
- [ ] Allow users to make events independent of squads, invite multiple squads to events, and/or invite specific people.
- [ ] Squads can have admins/moderators that post events (or allow anyone to post).
- [ ] Squads can be public or private (Invite only).
- [ ] Squads can have chats (squad leader can disable/enable), chats can be read only/certain people can post. Can set whether anyone can add/remove anyone, etc. Option to limit chat input (text vs pictures/videos vs links, etc). If people make plans in the chat, have options to create an event, and then flow for RSVP and rides would behave the same. (Would need smart text analysis to do this)
- [ ] Events have a name, time, location. Users in a squad RSVP whether they are going or not. Users who are going can be seen on a map for the event, to help with navigation. (People there can tell people trying to find the place where to go. Map is opt-in)
- [ ] For events, users can say whether they need a ride, or can give a ride, and the app will allow users to coordinate rides easily.
- [ ] Users can help pay for events through the app. (Event planner may pay for it all in a dinner scenario if everyone chips in to the event pool. Perhaps Google wallet integration.)

# Extended Feature List
- [ ] Companies/Big Events can send out event notifications to squads within a certain distance (radius). This would be a primary revenue stream, since ads are a no no.
- [ ] For public squads, show trending squads, biggest squads, squads with open events at the moment, etc.
- [ ] Allow users to encrypt their accounts/messages with PGP. We can either provide a key for them (simple interface for non technical users) or allow users to upload their own

# SquadUp as a full social network
- [ ] No Ads. Pay for site with above revenue stream/subscription. (Low rate, $3/month etc. Makes network seem exclusive, though might slow down early adoption. Perhaps give early users free access for a year etc.)
- [ ] Better search for people. For example, when searching within groups, filter by who's a friend or not. Also search by publicly available data. For example, if you want to know which college each of your friends is going to, you can filter by 'school' etc.
